Exploratory Data Analysis of Uber Ride Data in New York City.


In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of an Uber dataset, focusing on various aspects of ride data in New York City. The process involved several key steps:

1. Data Cleansing: We began by cleaning the dataset, removing duplicate rows and handling null entries to ensure data quality and accuracy.

2. Monthly Pickup Analysis: We derived new features from the existing data to analyze the number of pickups across different months. This helped identify the months with the maximum and minimum pickups, providing insights into seasonal trends.

3. Weekday Pickup Trends: Using grouped bar charts, we visualized the pickup trends on weekdays for each month, identifying the weekdays with the highest activity. Additionally, we used line plots to analyze the hourly pickup rates, offering a detailed view of peak times throughout the day.

4. Base Dispatching Analysis: To understand the activity levels of different dispatch bases, we conducted a 5-Point Summary analysis. This was complemented by visualizing the data with a box plot, revealing which bases had the most active vehicles.

5. Location-Based Analysis: We utilized map-based visualization to identify the locations in New York City (based on latitude and longitude) that experienced the highest rush of pickups. This geographical analysis highlighted the busiest areas in the city.
